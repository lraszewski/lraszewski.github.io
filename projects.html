				<h2>heming-hive</h2>
				<p>Heming Hive is the name of a tutoring web application that I built for a friend. The goal was to build a website that he could use to serve videos to his tutoring students, particularly in a time when face to face classes are unreliable. The web app needed to have secure authentication which could be managed by the client, easily handle crud operations and a responsive design. Additionally, it had to act as a front page for their business, and be both reliable and intuitive such that it became a joy to use.</p>
				<p>I built this application using node JS and MongoDB, EJS as my templating engine and a barebones CSS framework called Skeleton. You can access the Git Repository and README page <a href="https://github.com/lraszewski/heming-hive">here</a>.</p>

				<h2>portfolio</h2>
				<p>This is my portfolio website project. It's goal is to serve as the front end to all my projects, so that I can share my work publicly and with ease. This project embodies my devotion to the philosophy that less is more: It is as lightweight and simple as I can make it. As the founder of Lotus, Colin Chapman, stated "simplify, then add lightness". In this way, web design is very much like car design.</p>
				<p>I avoid as much bloat as I can, to keep this page fast and light. It is built with simple HTML and CSS. The repository for this site is <a href="https://github.com/lraszewski/lraszewski.github.io">here</a>.</p>

			<b>gradient</b> 2020 - present <br>
			At Gradient, I work with small teams on developing Automotive Software helping large companies such as Daimler (Mercedes) and Fiat-Chrysler Group manage their outward facing websites, as well as internal software to manage car maintenance, part ordering and repair, and client/customer data.
			</p>
			<p>
			The nature of the team environment has meant I am often working with different people in small groups, which has certainly developed further my communication and team work abilities. I have also found that this job allows me to put into practice skills I have learning in my computing degree at University, and thus develop my skills in Software Engineering further.

			<b>eastern mountain centre</b> 2017 - present <br>
			At EMC, I have gained experience in the operation of a ski rental and retail business, learning how to adjust, wax and maintain skis and snowboards, as well as size and fit rental downhill, cross country (skate and classic), touring and telemark skis, snowboards, and ski clothing.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to rentals, retail experience has provided me with an understanding of the technical aspects of ski equipment, as well as excellent communication and organisational skills. Working within a team has further fostered a focused work ethic and the ability to work efficiently within a team environment.

			<b>ben the butcher</b> 2017 - 2019 <br>
			At Ben the Butcher, I worked in the preparation of ready-made meals, at the counter, listening to and serving customers, as well as cleaning all areas of the shop to ensure a hygienic and sanitary work environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a result of working in food, I gained an unparalleled appreciation for the importance of procedure, and the maintenance of a clean workspace. Furthermore, I developed, and grew in confidence, my ability to serve and converse with customers, so as to provide the highest quality of customer service possible.
